# AR Fermentology Project

An Augmented Reality (AR) smartphone application for conducting and visualizing chemical fermentation experiments using Unity and Vuforia. The app is designed as an educational tool to help students and teachers understand the biochemical process of yeast fermenting sugar in a laboratory setting through interactive AR experiences.

## Features

- **Barcode Scanning:** Scan specific barcodes to trigger the fermentation reaction and start the experiment visualization.
- **Cross-Platform Deployment:** Available for both Android and iOS (distributed via TestFlight).
- **Interactive UI:** Custom-designed mobile interface using Unity UI Toolkit, with buttons, animations, and smooth transitions.
- **3D Models:** Realistic and detailed 3D models of laboratory materials created in Blender.
- **AI Chatbot Integration:** Text and voice-based interaction with an AI-supported chatbot for user assistance and educational support.
- **Animations:** Engaging animations demonstrating the biochemical process of fermentation.
- **Wireframes & Design:** Initial wireframes developed in PowerPoint and refined with Photoshop for polished visuals.
