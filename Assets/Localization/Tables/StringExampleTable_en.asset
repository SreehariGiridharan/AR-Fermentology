      Follow the instructions provided by your course instructor to conduct the experiment.
      This app will guide you by visualizing the particle processes throughout the
      experiment.\n\nThis AR learning environment was developed at the Technical
      University of Munich as part of the DigiProMIN project, led by Prof. Claudia
      Nerdel and Dr. Melanie Ripsam, and programmed by Sreehari Giridharan. If you
      have any questions or technical difficulties, please contact\_melanie.ripsam@tum.de\_"

      then 35\xB0C, and finally 100\xB0C. The temperature cannot be changed during
      the process. A progress bar, represented by a golden ring around the temperature
      button ( with a red button displaying the temperature), indicates the time
      left for each phase. The actual reaction must also follow this sequence.\n\nA
      demo button allows you to view a single molecule reaction in action. \n\nTo
      learn what each molecule represents, you can check the legend button for details."

    m_Localized: 'In this AR app, the reaction between yeast and sugar can be visualized
      to show how these components interact to produce carbon dioxide. Here''s how
      it works:


      When yeast is mixed with sugar in water, the yeast consumes
      the sugar in a process called fermentation. During this process, the yeast
      cells break down the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide. In an AR environment,
      you can augment this reaction by showing yeast particles interacting with sugar
      molecules, leading to the release of Carbon dioxide gas bubbles. This visual
      can help users understand how the yeast and sugar combine to create this gas,
      simulating real-life fermentation.'
