      activity depends on temperature:\r\n\r\n<b><color=#2E7D32>1. Flask at 5\xB0C
      (cold water):</color></b>\r\n- A very minimal reaction occurs.\r\n- The yeast
      shows little to no activity.\r\n- <b><color=#1A3B5D>Reason:</color></b> The
      yeast is not dead, but its metabolism is significantly slowed at this temperature.\r\n\r\n<b><color=#2E7D32>2.
      Flask at 35\xB0C (Optimal Temperature):</color></b>\r\n- A vigorous reaction
      occurs.\r\n- This leads to strong yeast activity.\r\n- <b><color=#1A3B5D>Reason:</color></b>
      35\xB0C is an ideal temperature for the enzymatic activity of yeast, especially
      for alcoholic fermentation.\r\n\r\n<b><color=#2E7D32>3. Flask at 100\xB0C (Boiling
      Water):</color></b>\r\n- No reaction occurs.\r\n- The yeast is denatured, as
      proteins and enzymes break down at this temperature.\r\n- <b><color=#1A3B5D>Reason:</color></b>
      Yeast dies at high temperatures, and the enzymes are irreversibly damaged.\r\n\r\n<b><color=#1A3B5D>Result</color></b>\r\n-
      Yeast is barely active at 5\xB0C.\r\n- At 35\xB0C, enzyme activity is at its
      highest, and strong fermentation occurs.\r\n- At 100\xB0C, no fermentation
      occurs.\n\n"
