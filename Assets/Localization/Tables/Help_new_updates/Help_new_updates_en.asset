    m_Localized: "The reaction between yeast and sugar is a fermentation process
      where yeast (a microorganism) breaks down sugar molecules in the absence of
      oxygen to produce carbon dioxide  and ethanol (alcohol). This process is called
      alcoholic fermentation.\n\nTemperature greatly affects    fermentation by influencing
      enzyme activity in yeast. At low temperatures, enzyme activity slows, reducing
      carbon dioxide production. Room temperature \n( around 35\xB0C) is optimal
      for maximum carbon dioxide production, while high temperatures denature enzymes,
      decreasing carbondioxide output and potentially killing the yeast."
